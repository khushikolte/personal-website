      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I’m Khushi Kolte, a freshman studying Cognitive Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley. I’m passionate about exploring the intersection of AI, data, and human behavior, and I enjoy working on projects that combine technical problem-solving with creativity. Outside of academics, I’ve led community STEM initiatives and shared my love for dance as an instructor.</p>
